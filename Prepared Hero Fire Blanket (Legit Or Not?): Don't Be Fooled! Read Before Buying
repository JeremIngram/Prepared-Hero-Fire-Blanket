Importance of Fire Safety
Having a fire blanket is part of a comprehensive fire safety plan. In homes, fires can ignite from various sources such as kitchens, heating equipment, and electrical malfunctions. In workplaces, especially in industries like manufacturing and hospitality, the risk is even higher. By incorporating a Prepared Hero Fire Blanket into your fire safety strategy, you can significantly reduce the risk of severe damage and injuries.
How to Use a Fire Blanket Safely
1. Assess the Situation: If a fire ignites, first ensure it is small and manageable. If the fire is large or spreading quickly, evacuate the area and call emergency services.
2. Deploy the Blanket: Hold the blanket by the corners to avoid burns. Gently place the blanket over the fire, covering it completely. Do not throw the blanket, as this can spread the flames.
3. Leave it in Place: Once the blanket is over the fire, leave it in place for several minutes to ensure the flames are completely extinguished.
4. Check for Reignition: After a few minutes, cautiously check if the fire has been extinguished before removing the blanket.
5. Seek Help if Needed: If the fire is still burning or if you are unsure, evacuate and contact emergency services immediately.
